excerpt: 'Remote sensing data indicates a considerable ability to map post-forest fire destructed areas and burned severity. In this research, the ability of spectral indices, 
which are difference Normalized Burned Ratio (dNBR), relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR), Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR), and difference Normalized Vegetation Index 
(dNDVI), in mapping burn severity was investigated. The research was conducted with free access moderate to high-resolution Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellite images for two 
forest fires cases that occurred in Izmir and Antalya provinces of Turkey.'
