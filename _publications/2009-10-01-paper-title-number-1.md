excerpt: 'The concept of entropy has its roots in the development of thermodynamics, a branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and energy transformations. The journey began 
in the early 19th century with the work of Sadi Carnot, his work on the efficiency of steam engines laid the foundation for understanding energy transformations and the 
limitations of converting heat into work.
In the mid-19th century, Rudolf Clausius formalized the principles of thermodynamics. In 1850, Clausius introduced the concept of the second law of thermodynamics, stating that 
the entropy of the universe tends to increase in all natural processes. He coined the term “entropy” in 1865 to describe the measure of disorder or randomness in a system, and 
formulated the mathematical expression of the second law, which asserts that entropy in an isolated system always increases over time.'
