excerpt: 'Analyzing the vertical structural complexity of tropical forests is essential for understanding their ecological functions and biodiversity. Given this significance, an indicator that quantifies entropy, representing heterogeneity and disorder in structural complexity, plays a significant role in forest ecological studies. This study explored the potential of the Lorenz-entropy (LE) index as an innovative metric for classifying tropical forest types. Using spaceborne LiDAR data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission from April 2019 to March 2023, we integrated the LE index with supervised machine learning algorithms to evaluate its effectiveness in distinguishing vertical structural complexity across the three tropical forest ecosystems. In addition to the LE index, forest structural variables such as Above Ground Biomass Density (AGBD), Plant Area Index (PAI), and Relative Height 98 (RH98) were â€¦'
