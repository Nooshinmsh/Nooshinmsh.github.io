excerpt: 'This study introduces an Entropy-based index: the Lorenz-entropy (LE) index, which we have developed by integrating Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), econometrics, and forest ecology. The main goal of the LE is to bridge the gap between theoretical entropy concepts and their practical applications in monitoring vertical structural complexity of tropical forest ecosystems. The LE index quantifies entropy by analyzing Relative Height (RH) metrics (representing a one-dimensional (1D) canopy structure metric) distributions from full-waveform LiDAR across successional stages in a tropical dry forest (TDF) and a tropical rainforest. To validate the LE trends derived from LiDAR, we extended the analysis using inventory-based two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) metrics, specifically basal area and biomass. The consistency of trends between the 1D LiDAR-derived LE and the inventory-based 2D and â€¦'
