I am a PhD in the Environmental and Ecological Sciences program. My work focuses on using remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to support environmental 
research. I am passionate and advanced in coding in R and Python, and I love exploring new ways to analyze data, solve challenges, and keep learning along the way. My research 
spans a wide range of topics, including forest fire, risk assessment, forest succession, liana infestation, and ecological modelling. I have contributed to various projects 
utilizing satellite imagery, Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data (TLS, ALS), and machine/deep learning to analyze environmental dynamics. My background reflects a deep 
engagement with diverse ecosystems, from boreal, and tropical forests to urban landscapes. I enjoy creating tools and workflows to solve ecological challenges and am continually 
inspired by the possibilities within my field.
